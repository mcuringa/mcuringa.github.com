### The MOOC and the Multitude

**Curinga, M.** (2016). [The MOOC and the Multitude](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/edth.12171). _Educational Theory_, _66_(3), 369–387. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/edth.12171>
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) take university lectures and other educational materials and make them available for free as online “courses.” Liberal and neoliberal MOOC supporters laud them for opening up education to the world, while incorporating market dynamics to improve quality and drive down costs. Skeptics claim MOOCs are a bald attempt to privatize higher learning, while creating an apartheid educational system with traditional universities for the wealthy and cut-rate online learning for everyone else. This paper draws on the political theory of autonomist marxism, arguing that MOOCs are Capital's defensive reaction to the threats of resistant universities on one side and unmanageable internet-based learning on the other. It then looks at what MOOC design would support education for the multitude; the diverse, networked political body of autonomist marxism.

### Mobile First Instructional Design

**Curinga, M.**, & Saravanos, A. (2016). [Mobile First Instructional Design](https://amzn.com/1522502513). In D. Mentor (Ed.), _Handbook of Research on Mobile Learning in Contemporary Classrooms_. IGI Global.
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** The rapid rise in mobile computing—primarily smartphones and tablets—has led
software and interface designers to adopt a “mobile first” strategy, where
they develop applications with mobile users in mind as the primary audience.
More than just bringing desktop computing to smaller devices, this turn has
opened up qualitatively different computing experience, refocusing interaction
design on high quality user experiences. This chapter explores the ways that
mobile first can help instructional designers realize a more contextual
learning experience embedded in the world. We look at the primary approaches
of mobile first design and then explore some cases of mobile design for
learning that foster authentic and deep learning.

### Critical analysis of interactive media with software affordances

**Curinga, M.** (2014). [Critical analysis of interactive media with software affordances](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4757/4116). _First Monday_, _19_(9). <http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v19i9.4757>
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** There is a long standing, and unsettled debate surrounding
the ways that technology influences society. There is strong scholarship
supporting the Social Construction perspective, arguing that the effects
of technology are wholly socially and politically determined. This paper
argues that the social constructivist position needs to be expanded if
it can be useful for more than observing the ways technologies are
designed and used. We need to develop better ways to talk about
software, computer hardware, and networks, so that we can describe the
social interpretations of these systems while accounting for their
unique characteristics. We suggest using software affordances as a way
to understand the semantics of software as interactive systems. Using
Facebook privacy concerns as a case study, we argue that software
affordances offer a useful lens for considering the social and political
implications of interactive software systems, providing us more
analytical tools to interpret, and not just describe, new technologies.

### New materialist approaches to the study of teacher identity

de Freitas, E. & **Curinga, M.** (2015). [New materialist approaches to the study of language and identity: Assembling the posthuman subject](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03626784.2015.1031059). _Curriculum Inquiry_. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03626784.2015.1031059>
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** Academic learning and social identity are intertwined,
making identity an enduring concept in the study of education. Two
methodologies commonly inform research on identity: critical discourse
analysis and conversation analysis. This paper argues that these
approaches fail to fully account for the complexity of teacher identity.
We outline a possible framework for combining these poststructuralist
tools of analysing language as meaning with new materialist tools for
studying language as material. The material approach moves language
beyond a reciprocal means of information-communication, considering its
capacity to create new orders and structures. This view is fruitful in
studying identity, offering a path around the agency-structure binary
where language either serves the subject in self-determination or the
institution in furthering normative control. Identity can be studied as
an assemblage that does not begin or end in the individual, where
language is one of several forces that dynamically constitute identities
in a given context.

### Social tutoring: incorporating social network and wiki features into the design of a novel computer science educational tool for collaborative study

**Curinga, M.** and Auchter, K. (2015). Designing 
PyTutor: A Social Tutor to Support Computer Science Education Through Collaborative Study. [_Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning_.](http://www.isls.org/cscl.html)
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** This paper reports on the design of PyTutor, a social tutor and study platform that offers computer supported collaborative learning of computer science, relying on peer instruction rather than artificial intelligence to provide just in time learning. The software provides a test-driven approach to authoring questions through a wiki-like interface allowing for the rapid, collaborative authoring of high quality questions, while replacing the expert domain modeling prevalent in cognitive tutors with a crowdsourced approach. A social networking model allows learners to reach out to their peers and mentors for help while studying.

### From laptop to tablet: faculty use of iPads for instruction to prepare education professionals

Battaglia, D., **Curinga, M.**, Minicozzi, L., McCarthy, M.J., Vaughn-Shavou, F., & Zarco, E. (2015). From laptop to tablet: a study of university faculty use of iPads to support instruction. _Excelsior: Leadership in Teaching and Learning_.
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** This paper reports on a university iPad pilot project
where a cohort of university faculty were given iPads for the purpose of
improving instruction for their graduate and undergraduate school of
education students in teacher preparation, health education, and speech
pathology programs. The researchers studied implementation details to
gather insight into instances where iPads were perceived to have a
positive impact on learning, and where they failed to meet expectations.
Findings indicate that, in the absence of extended professional
development over time, faculty with prior experience using tablet
computers and in fields that are already clinically saturated with iPad
use had the best chances of success in transition from desktop to mobile
computing.

### Wikiotics: The Interactive Language Instruction Wiki

Sullivan, I., Garrison, J. R., & **Curinga, M.** (2011). [Wikiotics: the interactive language instruction Wiki](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2038558.2038605). _Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration_ (pp. 223–224).
{: .ref}

**Abstract:** While most existing wiki systems are geared toward editing
text documents, we have built Wikiotics to enable the collaborative
creation of interactive multimedia materials most needed in language
instruction. In our demonstration, we will show several types of
interactive lessons that can be created from simple multimedia elements.
We will also show the lesson creation/editing interfaces and how our
smart phone app can simplify the process of capturing local media and
integrating that new media into existing lessons.
