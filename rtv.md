<h1>RewardTV</h1>
<p class="lead" markdown="1">
The <b>RewardTV</b> media trivia game represented the "gamification" of data collection of media consumption and effects. RewardTV was a high traffic website that featured a robust point-based e-commerce system in addition to the trivia games and surveys which powered Nielse Media data products. As _lead developer of web software_ and the technical team leader I was responsible for the overall software architecture of the site and managed a team of 25+ programmers, DBAs, and sysadmins.

I joined IAG Research when they were an early stage start-up and worked with them through acquisition by Nielsen Media. I worked closely with statistical analysts to help IAG pioneer new techniques in applying data science to analyze media trends across traditional and digital media.
