<strong>PyTutor</strong> is <code>social tutoring software</code> to help you learn the basics 
of programming in Python. We believe in community-supported learning and collaboration when learning to code. Solve programming challenges from our web-based interactive editor.

<u>Programming is a creative process!</u> Learn from <code>solutions</code> written by other users and question editors to learn new ways to solve problems.

We bring in features from <code>social networks</code> to make it easy to ask your friends for a little help if you get stuck. But don't worry, nobody (even your professor), can look at your code or the number of attempts you get right or wrong.

Our <code>wiki-like question editor</code> with test-driven question validation allows
many people to collaborate to write high-quality question prompts.
