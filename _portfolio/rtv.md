The **RewardTV** media trivia game represented the "gamification" of data collection of media consumption and effects. RewardTV was a high traffic website that featured a robust point-based e-commerce system in addition to the trivia games and surveys which powered IAG Research's data products. As _lead developer of web software_ and the technical team leader I was responsible for the overall software architecture of the site and managed a team of 25+ programmers, DBAs, and sysadmins.

I joined IAG Research when they were an early stage start-up and worked with them through acquisition by Nielsen Media. I worked closely with statistical analysts to help AIG pioneer new techniques in applying data science to the analyze media trends across traditional and new digital media.
