My first job as a programmer was building one of the first Content Management Systems, and I see [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) as a descendent of some of the work we did at Runtime. I have used it for dozens of development projects, setting up vanilla sites, and highly customized ones with new themes, short codes, functions, and plug-ins. Most of my professional PHP programming experience is with Wordpress.
