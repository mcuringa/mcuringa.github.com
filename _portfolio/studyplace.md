The **StudyPlace** wiki experimented in peer production as a means to create an online space for the academic study of social and educational philosophy. I oversaw both the technology and the community, working to create a self-sustaining community. I customized of the php-based MediaWiki, the software that powers both Wikipedia and StudyPlace. I also ran workshops on wiki authoring, wrote and categorized site content, and organized online and in-person “sprints”.
