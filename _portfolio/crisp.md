In 1999 we founded **Crisp Wireless** to write software for the emerging field “smartphone” applications. We focused on rich, downloadable software, rather than the "mobile web," making Crisp an early leader in app development and eventually leading to its successful acquisition.

As Chief Technical Officer I set the direction and wrote the key components of Crisp's flagship product, "mLogic." We were a handful of companies shaping the expectations of "apps" before the iPhone was released. We specialized in interactive social media, working on apps that featured photos, music, blogs, and fan interaction.

**Role:** CTO, senior software engineer
