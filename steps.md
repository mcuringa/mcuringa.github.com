<h1>STEPS to Literacy</h1>
<p class="lead">
The STEPS-to-Literacy design experiment investigated the ways a multimedia authoring platform for bilingual writers to study critical texts using a multiliteracies approach could improve their academic reading and writing skills. I was the lead instructor for trial studies with 8th grade Spanish-English bilingual students in the Bronx as well as lead software developer.
