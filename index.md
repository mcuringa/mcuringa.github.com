_Hi, I'm Matt Curinga._ I write software, research digital media, and teach in the [educational technology program at Adelphi University.](http://www.auedtech.org)

My recent **research** looks at the politics of software design. As an **instructional designer** and **programmer**, I've been building PyTutor, a web platform for studying computer programming (in python) which incorporates aspects of wikis, version control, and test suites for authoring questions; with social networks for peer tutoring. As an **educator** I have been focused on teaching computer science as a critical media literacy: at the graduate and undergraduate level, and recently as co-founder of [Zero Day Camp](https://zeroday.camp): a non-profit that teaches computing; and creates Free Open Source Software, tools, and curricula for (critical) computer science education.
