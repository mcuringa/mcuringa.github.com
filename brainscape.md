<h1>Brainscape</h1>
<p class="lead">
<a href="https://brainscape.com">Brainscape</a> is an educational technology start-up launched by a former student of mine from Teachers College. I worked as the first software architect and a lead developer on the Java and Android versions for launch. Brainscape is a flashcard study app designed on principles of cognitive load and meta cognition.
